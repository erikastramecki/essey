# Essey — RWA lending built around a formally-verified risk kernel

Multi-chain lending against tokenized real-world assets. Borrow a stablecoin against crypto and
tokenized equities, where the solvency rule is designed to be enforced by a **formally-verified
risk kernel** (dregg) with settlement gated by an **on-chain zk proof** (`sui::groth16`).
Non-custodial throughout: the borrower sends the transaction and supplies the collateral.

## What is actually proven today

The kernel and the proof design are real. **They are not yet what enforces the live code**, and
this section will change as that lands:

| | Status |
|---|---|
| dregg risk kernel (Lean 4) | Real and formally verified — but the operator falls back to an equivalent in-process LTV check when the kernel is absent, and says so via `authMode` |
| zk settlement (`sui::groth16`) | Verifier is live on-chain. **`dregg_lending` cannot originate and `settle_batch` cannot succeed** until both circuits are re-proven upstream |
| the circuits themselves | **Never audited.** `circuit/` contains a Poseidon gadget and no constraint system |
| Robinhood Chain (`rh-chain/`) | **No dregg.** LTV is enforced on-chain against a Chainlink feed — the same guarantee Aave gives, not a proof |

So: "provably safe" describes the design's goal, not the current deployment. What the contracts
enforce today is a conservative LTV check against a signed or on-chain price. Everything open is
listed in **[docs/OUTSTANDING.md](docs/OUTSTANDING.md)**.

**Live demo (devnet):** https://essey-sui-web.vercel.app  ·  Operator API: https://assay-operator-sui.vercel.app

**Security audits:** [docs/audits/](docs/audits/) — adversarial rounds with independent verification, published fix-first. **[docs/OUTSTANDING.md](docs/OUTSTANDING.md)** lists everything known-open, including items that block mainnet.

> Devnet + test assets only. Not an offer of securities. See `docs/` for the full design, risk
> framework, interest-rate model, and security audit.

```

## Run it locally
```bash
bash app/sui-harness/dev-up-sui.sh      # deploy + seed a pool + start the operator + write web/.env.local
cd app/web && npm run dev               # http://localhost:5173
```

## Deploy
```bash
bash app/deploy.sh            # web + operator (preflight tsc, build, deploy, pin alias, smoke check)
bash app/deploy.sh --web      # web only
```

## Add markets
```bash
bash app/sui-harness/add-market.sh spec.json   # publishes a small new coin pkg, appends to markets.json
bash app/sui-harness/deploy-markets.sh         # push registry/faucet + redeploy
```

## Dependencies & separation
- **Self-contained on Sui:** the contract vendors `dregg_verifier` locally; no reach into sibling repos.
- **Optional dregg kernel:** the operator's `/borrow` uses the formally-verified dregg kernel when a
  Rust `dregg` workspace is present (`DREGG` env), and an honest in-operator LTV+oracle fallback
  otherwise (flagged `authMode`). The on-chain guards are real either way. The hosted deploy runs the
  fallback (no Rust on serverless).
- **Secrets** (`.operator-sui.key`, `.env.*`) are git-ignored — never commit them.
- Contains **no CoinVoyage code**. The `dregg_verifier` copy is generic verifier code from the dregg
  project (same owner).

## Known backlog (see `docs/`)
Mainnet posture (real assets + regulatory read + independent audit), first-depositor share inflation
(MED, mitigated by seed), attestation single-use (LOW), hosted dregg-kernel host, BTC-collateral flow
(scoped, paused).
