/// Oracle gate for Robinhood Chain Stock Tokens.
///
/// WHY THIS EXISTS. Robinhood markets Stock Tokens as 24/7 tradeable, but the PRICE is not 24/7:
/// Chainlink equity feeds update 24/5, following US market hours, and go stale nights and
/// weekends. Lending against a Friday-close price through a weekend is the classic RWA blowup —
/// the stock gaps on Monday open and there was no window in which to liquidate.
///
/// Redundancy does not fix this. A second oracle (Pyth) reports the same closed market, so the
/// failures are correlated. The one uncorrelated source — the Stock Token's own 24/7 DEX price on
/// this chain — is thin and manipulable, and reintroduces exactly the flash-loan surface that
/// picking a signed-publisher oracle was meant to avoid. So the honest response to off-hours is
/// "there is no fresh price", not "synthesise one".
///
/// GROUNDED IN THE REAL FEED PARAMETERS. Every Chainlink feed on Robinhood Chain — all 34 equity
/// feeds and the crypto feeds alike — runs a **86400s (24h) heartbeat with a 0.5% deviation
/// trigger**. That is the actual contract, read from Chainlink's feed directory, and it shapes
/// this design:
///
///   - A staleness bound TIGHTER than the heartbeat is wrong and would revert constantly. An
///     earlier draft of this file used 3600s in-session and 300s off-hours; both would have
///     bricked the protocol every night, because a feed that has not moved 0.5% legitimately
///     does not update for up to 24 hours.
///   - The freshness guarantee that actually protects a lender is the DEVIATION threshold, not
///     the heartbeat: a price up to 24h old means "this has not moved more than 0.5% since".
///     The staleness bound therefore exists to catch a BROKEN oracle, not a quiet market, and is
///     set to heartbeat + grace.
///   - Off-hours protection cannot come from a tighter staleness bound, because when the market
///     is closed the price genuinely is not moving and no update is due. It comes from the
///     session flag: no new borrows, and no liquidations at a price nobody can verify.
///
/// This contract therefore does three things, and refuses to guess:
///   1. checks the L2 sequencer is up (and has been up long enough to trust)
///   2. checks the feed has not gone silent past heartbeat + grace (a broken-oracle check)
///   3. reports session state, so callers gate borrows and liquidations on a live market
///
/// It fails CLOSED everywhere. A revert is the correct outcome for an unknown price.
