/// THE PROBLEM. Robinhood Chain is an Arbitrum Orbit L2. If its sequencer halts, nothing executes
/// — nobody can repay, top up, or liquidate. That much is unavoidable. The damage happens on
/// RESTART: a backlog runs at once, liquidation bots are fastest, and a borrower who was healthy
/// when the chain died and fell 15% during the outage is liquidated in the first block back,
/// having had no opportunity to react. Chainlink's uptime feed exists to prevent exactly that, and
/// on this chain it could not be found (see StaleFeedGuard for the search).
///
/// WHY A "PAUSE ON OUTAGE" KEEPER DOES NOT WORK. The obvious design — watch for blocks stopping,
/// then pause — cannot send its pause transaction, because the chain it would send it to is down.
/// It could only act after resumption, racing the same backlog as the liquidators. It loses that
/// race, and a safety control that loses a race is not a safety control.
///
/// THE INVERSION. The keeper posts a HEARTBEAT on a schedule instead. Liquidations require a
/// recent heartbeat. If the chain halts the keeper cannot post, so on restart the heartbeat is
/// stale and liquidations are ALREADY disabled — no transaction needed at the critical moment, and
/// nothing to front-run. The default after any gap is "off". Fail-closed by construction.
///
/// This also covers keeper failure, sequencer failure, and RPC failure identically, because from
/// this contract's point of view they are the same event: the heartbeat stopped.
