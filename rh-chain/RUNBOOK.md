# Runbook — testnet to first loan

The local rig needs **no wallet at all**. Only a real mainnet loan does, and it is small: a few
dollars of gas, $50-100 of USDG to fund the pool, and a fraction of one AAPL share bought through
Robinhood.

## 0. Prove it first (no wallet, no gas)

```bash
cd rh-chain
forge test                                                        # 85 unit tests
forge test --match-path test/ForkMvp.t.sol \
  --fork-url https://rpc.mainnet.chain.robinhood.com -vv           # the MVP path on real state
```

The fork test deploys the stack against live mainnet, funds a pool with real USDG, borrows against
a real AAPL Stock Token priced by the real Chainlink feed, and repays. If that passes, the only
things testnet adds are your key and real block times.

## 1. Or run the whole thing locally, free

Robinhood Chain **testnet has none of the tokens** — no USDG, no Stock Tokens, no Chainlink feeds
(checked; all three addresses are undeployed there). Mocking all three would prove less than a fork
of mainnet does, so the zero-cost rig forks mainnet instead:

```bash
cd rh-chain && bash script/local-fork.sh
```

Forks mainnet, deploys the stack, serves out the 2-day timelock, jumps to a session open, and beats
the keeper through the grace period. Prints the MCP command when `canBorrow` is true. Real AAPL,
real USDG, real mainnet price, anvil's prefunded keys — **no wallet, no gas, no money.**

The one synthetic part is the price feed's *timestamp*: forking pins the real feed's `updatedAt` at
fork height and the timelock forces the clock past it, so `AlwaysFreshFeed` reports the real
mainnet price at the current block time. Fork-only, and labelled as such.

## 2. Deploy for real

```bash
export PK=0x…                       # a testnet key
cd rh-chain
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=script forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url rh_testnet --broadcast --private-key $PK
```

Set `USDG`, `STOCK`, `FEED` in env if the testnet addresses differ from mainnet's. Every decimal is
read from the chain and asserted, so a wrong address fails loudly rather than deploying a market
that misprices by 1e12.

Record the three printed addresses.

## 3. Start the clock and the keeper

The market is **proposed, not live** — there is a 2-day timelock. Start it now; it runs while you
do everything else.

```bash
cd rh-chain/keeper && npm install
LIVENESS_ORACLE=<liveness> KEEPER_PRIVKEY=$PK \
  RH_RPC=https://rpc.testnet.chain.robinhood.com/rpc node liveness-keeper.mjs
```

Liquidations stay disabled until the keeper has been beating for the grace period. That is
deliberate: a fresh deployment has not proven liveness.

After 2 days:

```bash
cast send <markets> "commitMarket(address)" <stock> --rpc-url rh_testnet --private-key $PK
```

## 4. Borrow, from an agent

```bash
cd mcp && npm install
ESSEY_CHAIN=rh-testnet ESSEY_POOL=<pool> ESSEY_MARKETS=<markets> node essey-mcp.mjs
```

Register it with your MCP client alongside Robinhood's Trading MCP. Then, in one conversation:

1. *"Buy 10 shares of AAPL"* → Robinhood Trading MCP, under your own credentials
2. wait for settlement → the Stock Token lands in your self-custody wallet
3. *"What can I borrow against my AAPL?"* → `essey_quote`
4. *"Borrow $500"* → `essey_borrow` returns unsigned calldata; your wallet signs
5. *"How's my loan?"* → `essey_health`
6. *"Repay it"* → `essey_repay`

Step 4 is the moment the MVP exists.

## Known limits at this stage

Testnet, one lender, one borrower. `docs/OUTSTANDING.md` lists every open finding — none blocks a
single-user demo, and all of them start mattering the moment real users arrive.
