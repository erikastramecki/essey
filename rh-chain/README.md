# Essey on Robinhood Chain

Solidity port. See `../docs/SCOPE-robinhood-chain.md` for the full design rationale and the
Phase 0 findings that ground it.

```
forge soldeer install 2>/dev/null || {   # deps are NOT vendored — install them first
  forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
  forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@v5.6.1
}
forge test                          # unit tests
node phase0-verify.mjs              # re-verify live chain assumptions (no keys, no gas)
```

`lib/`, `out/` and `cache/` are gitignored: dependencies are reproduced by `forge install`
rather than vendored, so the repo does not carry thousands of third-party files.

## Conservative risk stance (v1)

Set deliberately low, to be raised as the MVP proves itself — not lowered after an incident.

| Parameter | Single-name equity | Broad ETF | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Max LTV | **35%** | **45%** | The borrow ceiling |
| Liquidation threshold | **55%** | **65%** | — |
| **Gap buffer** | **20pp** | **20pp** | **The number that matters** |
| Liquidation bonus | 8% | 8% | Above the usual 5%: liquidators carry stale-price risk |
| Off-hours new borrows | blocked | blocked | No fresh price means no new exposure |

**The buffer, not the LTV, is the safety margin.** The feed is blind for 60+ hours a week, so a
position can only be liquidated after the market reopens. A 20-percentage-point gap between LTV and
liquidation threshold means a position opened at max LTV survives roughly a 30% adverse move before
going underwater — which covers most weekend gaps in single-name equities, and comfortably covers
index ETFs.

Three risks stack here and none of them is hedgeable:
- collateral is a **Jersey debt token**, not equity — Robinhood counterparty risk
- `adminBurn` can destroy it, held by a **plain EOA** with no multisig or timelock
- the price is **blind nights and weekends**

## Oracle reality (grounded, not assumed)

Every Chainlink feed on Robinhood Chain — all 34 Robinhood equity feeds and the crypto feeds —
runs an **86,400s (24h) heartbeat with a 0.5% deviation trigger**. Pulled from Chainlink's feed
directory via `node script/fetch-feeds.mjs`, which fails loudly if the heartbeat ever changes.

This shaped the design, and corrected a mistake:

- A staleness bound **tighter than the heartbeat is wrong**. The first draft used 3600s in-session
  and 300s off-hours. The live AAPL feed was ~2.4 hours old when checked, quoting $326.49 — a
  perfectly healthy price that both of those bounds would have rejected. It would have bricked
  borrowing every quiet hour and every night.
- The guarantee that protects a lender is the **deviation threshold, not the heartbeat**: a price
  up to 24h old means "this has not moved 0.5% since". So the staleness bound exists to catch a
  **broken** oracle, not a quiet market, and is set to heartbeat + 1h grace (90,000s).
- **Off-hours protection cannot come from a staleness bound**, because when the market is shut the
  price genuinely is not moving and no update is due. It comes from the session flag: no new
  borrows, and no liquidation at a price nobody can verify. The LTV buffer carries the rest.

`_setFeed` rejects any `maxStaleness` below the heartbeat, so this class of misconfiguration
cannot be deployed.

## Chain liveness (standing in for the missing sequencer feed)

Robinhood Chain has no locatable Chainlink L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed (see the scope doc). Without
one, the danger is not the outage itself — during a halt nothing executes at all — it is the
RESTART: a backlog runs at once, liquidation bots are fastest, and a borrower who was healthy when
the chain died gets liquidated in the first block back with no chance to react.

**A "pause on outage" keeper cannot work.** It would have to send its pause transaction to a chain
that is down. It could only act after restart, racing the same backlog as the liquidators, and it
would lose. A safety control that loses a race is not a safety control.

`LivenessOracle` inverts it. The keeper posts a **heartbeat** on a schedule; liquidations require a
recent one. If the chain halts, the keeper cannot post, so on restart liquidations are **already**
disabled — no transaction needed at the critical moment, and nothing to front-run. The first
heartbeat after a gap starts a grace period rather than reopening, so borrowers get a window to
repay or top up. Repay and top-up are never gated on liveness: during a recovery those are exactly
the actions a borrower needs, and blocking them would make the control cause the liquidation it
exists to prevent.

Keeper failure, RPC failure and chain failure are all the same event here — the heartbeat stopped —
and all fail closed.

```
RH_RPC=... KEEPER_PRIVKEY=0x... LIVENESS_ORACLE=0x... node keeper/liveness-keeper.mjs
```

Run under a supervisor and alert on the WARN/ALERT lines: a silently dead keeper degrades to
"liquidations off", which is safe but is an outage of its own.

## Modules

- `EsseyPool` — lender vault (USDG in, transferable ERC-20 shares), borrow-index accrual,
  borrow / repay / liquidate. The accrual and share maths are ported from the Sui implementation,
  the one part of that codebase six adversarial audit rounds never landed a confirmed finding
  against. Each audit-derived invariant is carried over and marked with the finding that taught it.
- `EsseyMarkets` — risk registry. Which Stock Tokens are accepted, on what terms, and when.
  Enforces `MIN_RISK_GAP_BPS` (20pp) in code, so a future parameter change cannot quietly narrow
  the one thing protecting lenders. Parameter changes are timelocked 2 days and re-validated at
  commit; disabling a market is immediate, because turning lending off is always safe.
- `LivenessOracle` — heartbeat-based chain-liveness gate; fail-closed, no race on restart.
- `StaleFeedGuard` — sequencer uptime + grace period, a single per-feed staleness bound sized to the 86400s heartbeat
  (an earlier draft had a tighter off-hours bound; it was wrong and was removed), session reporting. Fails closed. A revert is the right answer to an unknown price.
- `CollateralReconciler` — never trusts a stored balance; detects `adminBurn` shortfall without
  reverting (reverting would freeze every other borrower); values via the live `uiMultiplier` so a
  stock split cannot misprice positions.

## Testing standard

Every guard must die under mutation. `forge test` passing is necessary, not sufficient — in the
Sui codebase four guards were deletable with a fully green suite. Before claiming a guard is
covered, delete it and watch a test fail.
