# Outstanding

Everything known-open, as of 2026-07-20. Written down so none of it lives only in someone's head.

## Blockers before any mainnet deployment

**1. No round has ever come back clean.** The stated gate is three auditors clean in the same
round. Six Move rounds and one Solidity round; none met it. Severity is falling and the remaining
items are mediums, but the gate is unmet and the code is unpushed-to-production for that reason.

**2. The ZK layer has never been audited, and cannot be.** `circuit/` contains a Poseidon gadget
and **no constraint system**. There is no `.zkey`, `.r1cs`, `.ptau` or `.wasm` anywhere. Audit
findings F1 and F4 both turn on what the batch proof binds, so the most load-bearing component in
the "provably safe" claim is the one nobody has been able to check.

**3. Both circuits must be re-proven upstream.** `dregg_lending` cannot originate and
`settle_batch` cannot succeed until they are. This is deliberate — a lending function that can be
drained must not originate loans — but it is blocked outside this repo.
`perloan-prep/RUNBOOK-terms-binding.md` still specifies the **pre-fix 8-term preimage**; it needs
the collateral-type term or the on-chain binding will never match.

**4. ~~`README.md` claims "provably safe."~~ FIXED.** The README now leads with a "What is
actually proven today" table separating the design's goal from what the deployment enforces, and
the strongest claims in `WHY-ESSEY-IS-DIFFERENT.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` were softened to match.
Re-tighten the language as the circuits land and are audited — the table is meant to change.

**5. Republish required.** `Pool`, `Position` and `OperatorCap` all changed layout, so Sui cannot
upgrade in place. Needs a fresh package, a fresh pool, and a new `VITE_POOL`.

## Open findings

### Move (`move/`)

| Severity | Item |
|---|---|
| high | `disburse_entry` hands a cap holder the whole `pool.cap` against zero collateral — no signature, no delay, no pause check. **A trust-model decision, not a patch:** is the cap holder trusted with the full pool, or does that path need an attestation too? |
| medium | `repay` demands exact equality against a debt that grows every second, with no on-chain debt view to size it from. Fixed by construction in the Solidity port; not backported. |
| low | Faucet rate limit keyed on the raw request string, bypassable by address casing/padding. Devnet only. |

### Solidity (`rh-chain/`)

| Severity | Item |
|---|---|
| critical | A watched token returning a non-boolean `paused()` word makes `abi.decode` panic inside `accrue()`, freezing **every** entry point — including liquidation — until a single admin EOA resets the array. |
| high | Pro-rata collateral is correct on CLOSE but wrong on OPEN: the denominator is live, so anyone who borrows **after** a burn is charged for it. |
| high | The decimals fix moved the trust into two operator-typed fields that nothing cross-checks against the token's real `decimals()`. A one-character typo reproduces the original 1e12 drain. |
| high | `accrue()` runs **after** OZ computes the share price in all four ERC4626 paths, so pending interest is extractable — and flash-loanable. |
| medium | Pause suspends interest **pool-wide** and forgives it permanently, so an unrelated token's pause hands every borrower a free loan. |
| medium | DST intersection does not handle the ~3 half-day early closes per year. |
| medium | The holiday guard false-rejects on EDT days whose only print lands in the 13:30–14:30 opening hour — and because `canLiquidate` shares the flag, that is a liquidation outage. |
| medium | `resumeGrace` at 6× `gapThreshold` turns routine keeper jitter into a permanent liquidation DoS. |
| medium | ~50 mutations survive a green suite, including `MIN_RISK_GAP_BPS` and `PARAM_TIMELOCK`. |

**Round 2 was not clean.** This is the fourth consecutive round in which a shipped fix either did
not work or introduced a new defect, and the third in which a claim I made in a commit message or
document was disproven by the next round.

Nothing in `rh-chain/` is deployed to any network.

## Operational, before mainnet

- **Deploy the `LivenessOracle` keeper** under a supervisor with alerting. It exists and is tested;
  it is not running. A silently dead keeper degrades to "liquidations off" — safe, but an outage.
- **Split the keys.** The keeper's hot key must not be the cold guardian key, and the Sui keeper
  currently co-locates the `OperatorCap` and the operator signing key in one process, which
  collapses a two-party control into one.
- **Sequencer uptime feed.** Robinhood's docs say Chainlink provides one for Robinhood Chain; it is
  not on Chainlink's canonical list, not in the feed directory, and every contract from Chainlink's
  deployer on that chain resolves to a price feed. Either locate it (ask
  `chain-developers-group@robinhood.com`) or keep running on the keeper.
- **Verify who holds `ADMIN_BURNER_ROLE`.** On-chain it is a plain EOA with no multisig and no
  timelock — one key can destroy collateral inside a live pool. That is unmitigated on-chain and
  should be priced into LTV and disclosed to borrowers.

## Open questions

1. Can Robinhood's Trading MCP place the equity orders that become Stock Tokens, in the
   jurisdictions we care about? The agent half of the MVP is untested end-to-end.
2. Chainlink feed heartbeats are 86400s / 0.5% today. `rh-chain/script/fetch-feeds.mjs` fails loudly
   if that changes — but nothing runs it on a schedule yet.
3. Has `adminBurn` ever actually been used? Recoverable from `Transfer`-to-zero logs; frequency
   decides whether it is theoretical or operational.
