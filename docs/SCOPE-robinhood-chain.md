# Scope — Essey on Robinhood Chain

Target MVP: a user signs in via their own MCP, an AI agent buys stock on Robinhood, the Stock
Token lands in their self-custody wallet, and they borrow against it in Essey.

All contract facts below were read from the **deployed, verified source** on
`robinhoodchain.blockscout.com`, not from documentation — the docs contradicted themselves and
several widely-cited third-party write-ups are wrong about transfer restrictions.

> **Scope note.** This document is the **lending-engine** scope: the port of the Sui pool/borrow/

## 0. The finding that reframes the port

`AAPL • Robinhood Token` (`0xaF3D76f1834A1d425780943C99Ea8A608f8a93f9`) is an eip1967 beacon proxy
to a verified `Stock` implementation (`0xb35490d6f9163DE4F80d88dc75c3516eb64C5aE2`):

```solidity
contract Stock is IStock, AccessControlled, OraclePausable, ERC20ScaledUIUpgradeable

function transfer(address to, uint256 value) public override
    onlyNotPaused onlyNotBlocked(to) onlyNotBlocked(_msgSender())

modifier onlyNotBlocked(address account) {
    if (IAccessControlsRegistry(ACCESS_CONTROLLED_REGISTRY).isBlocked(account)) revert Blocked(account);
    _;
}
```

`isBlocked` is a **deny-list, not an allow-list**. Any address — including an arbitrary
third-party lending pool — can receive and hold Stock Tokens today. No KYC gate, no whitelist, no
integration agreement at the contract layer.

**And Robinhood Chain has on-chain Chainlink price feeds for every Stock Token**, using the same
`AggregatorV3Interface` / `latestRoundData()` as any crypto feed.

That second fact is the important one. On Sui there is no on-chain oracle, so the operator signs
prices off-chain and the contract verifies an ed25519 attestation. Essentially every mechanism
hardened across audit rounds F2–R6 — expiry windows, nullifiers, pool binding, domain separation,
the two-key liquidation dance, `MAX_ATTEST_WINDOW_S`, the whole cross-language byte-pinning
apparatus — exists **to compensate for the absence of an on-chain price**.

**The port is therefore a simplification, not a translation.** Roughly 60% of the Sui contract's
complexity does not need to exist on Robinhood Chain.

---

## 1. What carries over, what disappears

### Carries over — the invariants the audits actually bought

These are design conclusions, not code. They transfer directly to Solidity:

| Invariant | Origin |
|---|---|
| Authorisation must bind the **loan's actual terms** — debt, collateral amount **and type** | F1, R5-1 |
| Liquidation needs a **real health check** and must **refund surplus** to the borrower | F3 |
| Every capability must be **bound to the pool it governs** | R2-1 |
| Position objects must be **bound to their pool** | R3 |
| Exposure ledgers must **release on close**, exactly once, with no double-release path | R5-3, R6-B1 |
| Rate parameters must be **bounded**; overflow must saturate, never trap funds | R2-2 |
| Privilege changes need a **timelock**, so rotate-and-use is not atomic | R5-2 |
| Guards need **mutation tests** — four guards in this codebase were deletable with a green suite | R4, R6 |

### Disappears — machinery that only existed for the missing oracle

- The entire ed25519 attestation path (`attest_msg`, `disburse_attested`, expiry, window, nullifier)
- Domain separation between message types (only needed because two things were signed)
- Cross-language byte-pinning between TS and Move
- The operator's role as *price authority*
- Two-party liquidation, the rotation timelock, `pending_pubkey` state
- `pause` as a key-compromise kill switch

Liquidation becomes **permissionless with an on-chain health check** — which is what F3 was
reaching for and could not achieve without an oracle.

### The ZK/dregg layer

`settle_batch`, the Poseidon accumulator, and `loan_commit_of` were the "provably safe"
differentiator. **This is the one real decision to make.** With on-chain LTV enforcement, the
proof is no longer load-bearing for solvency — the contract can enforce the invariant directly.
Options:

1. **Drop it for v1 on this chain.** Simplest, honest, ships fastest. The safety story becomes
   "the contract enforces LTV against a Chainlink feed" — the same as Aave, which is a weaker
   claim than "provably safe" but is *true today*, unlike the current claim.
2. **Keep it as an additional attestation** over the dregg kernel's decision, layered on top of
   on-chain enforcement. Preserves the differentiator; costs the circuit work that is already
   blocking `dregg_lending` origination.

Recommendation: **ship v1 without it, keep the hook.** The circuit work is upstream-blocked and
should not gate a working product.

*Where provable-solvency actually lives now:* in the deployed product the "provably safe" claim is
carried by the **Cases/Degen worst-case-reserve** mechanism — a bounded, on-chain reserve sized to
cover the worst payout — not by a lending circuit. The lending path here enforces LTV directly in
Solidity; the ZK hook stays optional.

---

## 2. What is NEW and Robinhood-specific

These have no analogue in the Sui design and are the real engineering risk.

### 2.1 `adminBurn` — collateral can be destroyed in place

```solidity
function adminBurn(address from, uint256 amount) public override onlyRole(ADMIN_BURNER_ROLE) {
    _burn(from, amount);
}
```

Note what is **absent**: no `onlyNotPaused`, no `onlyNotBlocked`. Robinhood can burn Stock Tokens
out of **any** address, including a live lending pool, unconditionally.

An open loan can become instantly unsecured with **nothing left to liquidate**.

Design consequences:
- **Never trust a stored collateral figure.** Read `balanceOf(pool)` and reconcile against the sum
  of recorded positions on every state-changing call.
- Add an explicit **shortfall path**: when actual < recorded, the deficit is socialised to lenders
  or absorbed by reserves — decided in code, not discovered in production.
- This risk must be **disclosed in the UI and priced into LTV**. It is not a bug to fix; it is a
  property of the collateral.

### 2.2 `uiMultiplier` — corporate actions rescale the position mid-loan

```solidity
function balanceOfUI(address a) public view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(balanceOf(a), uiMultiplier(), DENOMINATOR);
}
function _updateUIMultiplier(uint256 newMultiplier, uint256 effectiveAt_) internal { ... }
```

`balanceOf()` is the raw amount and is **stable**; `balanceOfUI()` is the share-equivalent and
**changes on splits and other corporate actions**. The multiplier can be **scheduled** with a
future `effectiveAt`, so it changes **without any transaction touching the pool**.

- Collateral must be valued as **`balanceOfUI × price`**, never `balanceOf × price`. Pricing the
  raw balance misprices every position by the split ratio the moment a split lands — wrongly
  liquidating healthy loans or silently under-collateralising others.
- Health checks must re-read `uiMultiplier()` every time; caching it is a bug with a delayed fuse.
- Add a **scheduled-multiplier alert** so a pending corporate action is visible before it fires.

### 2.3 Global pause traps repay and liquidate

`paused()` returns token-level **OR** registry-level pause. When Robinhood pauses, `transfer` and
`transferFrom` revert — so **borrowers cannot repay and liquidators cannot seize**, while interest
keeps accruing.

- Accrual must be **suspended while the collateral token is paused**, or borrowers are charged for
  a window in which they were structurally unable to repay.
- Liquidation eligibility should be evaluated on **unpaused time**, not wall-clock.

### 2.4 Beacon proxy — the token is upgradeable

All Stock Tokens share one implementation behind a beacon. Transfer semantics, the multiplier
mechanism, and the burn powers can all change for every token simultaneously. Assume the interface
is stable; assume the **policy is not**.

### 2.5 Collateral is a Jersey debt token, not equity

Stock Tokens are **tokenised debt securities** issued by Robinhood Assets (Jersey) Limited, giving
economic exposure with **no legal or beneficial right in the underlying share**. Collateral quality
is Robinhood-Jersey counterparty risk. This belongs in risk parameters and in plain language in the
UI — especially alongside any safety claim.

## 3. Contract surface (v1)

Solidity, Robinhood Chain (Arbitrum Orbit, EVM). Borrow asset: **USDG**
(`0x5fc5360D0400a0Fd4f2af552ADD042D716F1d168`).

```
EsseyPool.sol          ERC-4626-style lender vault, USDG deposits, share accounting
                       borrow-index accrual (port the Sui curve, keep the R2-2 bounds
                       and saturating math — that logic was correct and is chain-agnostic)

EsseyMarkets.sol       per-collateral registry: Stock Token address, Chainlink feed,
                       ltvBps, liqThresholdBps, liqBonusBps, per-collateral cap
                       (the isolation cap from the Sui design, which held up in audit)

EsseyBorrow.sol        openPosition: pull collateral, read latestRoundData + uiMultiplier,
                       enforce LTV on-chain, disburse USDG
                       repay: >= owed with change returned (fixes known-open F5 by
                       construction — do NOT port the exact-equality bug)

EsseyLiquidate.sol     permissionless. health = balanceOfUI x price x liqThreshold / debt
                       seize only debt x (1 + bonus), REFUND SURPLUS (F3)
                       reconcile balanceOf before seizing (adminBurn shortfall path)

EsseyGuard.sol         oracle staleness + sequencer-uptime checks, pause-aware accrual,
                       shortfall accounting, timelocked admin (R5-2)
```

**Reuse rather than re-derive:** OpenZeppelin for ERC-20/4626/AccessControl/TimelockController,
and Chainlink's `AggregatorV3Interface`. The audit findings that were about *hand-rolled*
primitives (low-order pubkey validation, BCS byte pinning, limb splitting) vanish entirely —
that whole class of bug came from writing crypto by hand.

**Oracle discipline to port from `operator/pyth.mjs`** — that layer was repeatedly confirmed sound:
staleness bounds, confidence-interval rejection, fail-closed on error, market-hours awareness. On
an L2 also check **sequencer uptime** before trusting a feed; this is the standard Arbitrum
L2 gotcha and is not in the Sui design because it could not be.

---

## 4. The agent / MCP flow

The half that is **available today** and is the actual product hook:

```
1. User connects their own MCP client to Robinhood's Trading MCP
   -> "connect a third-party AI agent to a dedicated Robinhood account"
   -> agent places the equity order under the user's own credentials.
      Essey never holds the account. No custody, no licensing exposure.

2. Robinhood settles the position as a Stock Token in the user's
   self-custody Robinhood Wallet on Robinhood Chain.

3. Essey dApp (or an Essey MCP tool) reads the wallet, prices via Chainlink,
   quotes a borrow.

4. User approves + openPosition in one tx. USDG lands in their wallet.
   Collateral sits in EsseyPool, on the same chain, no bridge.
```

Essey is **never** a custodian at any step, which preserves the non-custodial property that the
custody alternative would have destroyed.

**Worth building: an Essey MCP server.** If the user already drives Robinhood through MCP, exposing
`essey.quote`, `essey.borrow`, `essey.health`, `essey.repay` as MCP tools makes the whole flow one
conversation. That is a genuine differentiator and is small next to the contract work.

**Verify before relying on it:** Trading MCP availability by jurisdiction, whether agent trading
covers the equities that become Stock Tokens, and the settlement path/latency from order fill to
token in wallet.

## 5. Phasing

Status as of this revision: Phases 1–2 are **largely delivered on testnet** — the lending core
(EsseyPool / EsseyMarkets / Borrow / Liquidate) is deployed on Robinhood Chain **testnet** and has
been through adversarial audit rounds, with **open borrowing switching on ~Aug 5 2026**. What
remains gated is **mainnet**: the Solidity has not been deployed to chainId 4663, and Phase 4's
all-clean audit round plus the sequencer-feed blocker (Section 6) stand between testnet and mainnet.

| Phase | Work | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — Spike** | All assumptions verified against live mainnet with zero gas and no keys: deny-list default-open, sequencer uptime feed exists, testnet exists, and 67 contracts already hold Stock Tokens in production. `rh-chain/phase0-verify.mjs`, 7/7. | ✅ **DONE** — passed |
| **1 — Core** | EsseyPool + Markets + Borrow + Liquidate, on-chain LTV, surplus refund, `balanceOfUI` pricing, sequencer check | ✅ **DELIVERED on testnet** — deployed and adversarially audited; open borrowing switches on ~Aug 5 2026. Guard mutation-testing remains the standing discipline *(claimed-and-wrong twice before — an independent sweep of 139 mutations found 50 survivors — so treat coverage as continuously earned, not a checkbox).* |
| **2 — RH hazards** | `adminBurn` reconciliation + shortfall path, pause-aware accrual, scheduled-multiplier handling | ✅ **Largely delivered on testnet** — fork tests against real Stock Tokens. |
| **3 — Agent** | Essey MCP server, dApp borrow flow, Robinhood Wallet integration | In progress — end-to-end on testnet. |
| **4 — Audit** | Fresh adversarial rounds on the Solidity | ⏳ **Gates mainnet** — all-clean round required before mainnet (chainId 4663). |
| **5 — Hybrid** (optional) | Sui pools for non-Robinhood RWA; shared markets/risk config. **CCIP** already moves Stock Tokens cross-chain — evaluate, do not assume Sui is a supported lane. | — |

## 6. Open questions

**RESOLVED in Phase 0 (2026-07-20)** — verified against live mainnet, chainId 4663:

- ✅ **Deny-list confirmed empirically.** `isBlocked()` returns false for a never-used address, the
  zero address, vitalik.eth and a plain mainnet contract address. Default-open. Registry is
  `0xe10b6f6b275de231345c20d14ab812db62151b00`. Run `node rh-chain/phase0-verify.mjs` to re-check.
- ~~✅ **Sequencer uptime feed EXISTS.**~~ **SUPERSEDED — see the blocker below.** This line was written from Robinhood's docs and was never verified on-chain; `phase0-verify.mjs` contains no sequencer check. We could not locate the feed. `StaleFeedGuard` ships with the check disabled and a keeper heartbeat in its place. The original claim: Chainlink publishes an L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed for
  Robinhood Chain: *"check it before reading any price."* Liquidation safety is achievable.
- ✅ **There is a TESTNET** (chainId 46630, `https://rpc.testnet.chain.robinhood.com/rpc`), so
  Phases 0–3 need no real money.
- ✅ Registry and all four sampled Stock Tokens are currently unpaused; `uiMultiplier` is 1.0
  across AAPL/TSLA/NVDA/SPY (no corporate action applied yet — so a split has never yet exercised
  that code path in production).
- ⚠️ **Stock feeds update 24/5, following market hours — they go STALE nights and weekends.**
  This is the significant one and it changes risk design. Robinhood Chain markets Stock Tokens as
  24/7 tradeable, but the *price* is not 24/7. Borrowing against a Friday-close price through a
  weekend gap is the classic RWA blowup: the stock gaps on Monday open and no liquidation was
  possible in between. Required response, decided deliberately rather than by default:
  a materially lower LTV while the feed is stale, and/or blocking new borrows off-hours, and
  liquidation eligibility evaluated on unpaused, fresh-feed time. The Sui operator already
  encoded this instinct (`maxStaleOffHoursSecs`, market-hours awareness in `operator/pyth.mjs`) —
  on this chain it becomes an on-chain concern.

**Still open:**

1. ~~Feed heartbeats and deviation thresholds~~ **RESOLVED.** All 34 Robinhood equity feeds (and
   the crypto feeds) are **86400s heartbeat / 0.5% deviation**, from Chainlink's feed directory.
   This corrected a real bug: the first `StaleFeedGuard` draft used bounds TIGHTER than the
   heartbeat and would have rejected healthy prices constantly — the live AAPL feed read $326.49
   at ~2.4h old, which my own guard would have refused. Regenerate with
   `node rh-chain/script/fetch-feeds.mjs`, which exits non-zero if the heartbeat ever changes.

2. 🚩 **BLOCKER — the L2 sequencer uptime feed cannot be found.** Robinhood's docs say
   *"Chainlink provides an L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed for this; check it before reading any price."*
   It is not on Chainlink's canonical L2 sequencer feed list, not in the Robinhood feed directory,
   not findable by name search, and every contract from Chainlink's deployer on this chain
   resolves to a price feed. Their docs have already been wrong once about this chain, so the
   claim alone is not evidence.

   Without it: during an outage nothing executes and nothing can be liquidated; on resumption a
   backlog runs against prices users had no chance to react to. The 24h heartbeat means staleness
   detection would not notice an outage for a full day — far too slow to substitute.

   `StaleFeedGuard` accepts `address(0)` and exposes `sequencerCheckDisabled()` so the gap is
   advertised rather than silently skipped. **Resolve before mainnet**: either locate the feed
   (ask `chain-developers-group@robinhood.com`) or accept it explicitly with the LTV buffer and an
   off-chain pause keeper as the compensating controls.
2. **Has `adminBurn` ever been used?** Check historical `Transfer`-to-zero events from admin roles.
   Frequency changes whether this is theoretical or operational.
3. ~~Who holds `ADMIN_BURNER_ROLE`?~~ **RESOLVED — and it is the worst of the plausible answers.**
   Recovered from `RoleGranted` logs on the registry (the contract lacks `AccessControlEnumerable`,
   so RPC enumeration reverts):

   | Role | Holder | Type |
   |---|---|---|
   | `ADMIN_BURNER_ROLE` | `0x957b6de6525c63349f7619743ef1e0ad93cd74d4` | **EOA** |
   | `TOKEN_PAUSER_ROLE` | `0xfccf56b674113d9c4eb0f9b3370930ced9e6ab23` | **EOA** |
   | `MINTER_ROLE` | `0x2b94105fff37630f98e1f24811dad588fc5c3a87` | **EOA** |
   | `MULTIPLIER_UPDATER_ROLE` | `0x92905e8d0e2301ba143215b8d86d63ffd4188143` | **EOA** |
   | `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | `0xd6f8378f8e440c65f8382f5f2728c78dfd55b66d`, `0x074377a78a9710a1d47244f89797718b4f491279` | **EOA** |

   Every privileged role is a plain externally-owned account. No multisig, no timelock, no on-chain
   governance delay anywhere in the stack. A single key can burn collateral out of a live pool; a
   single key can freeze every Stock Token; `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` can grant itself any other role.

   **Honest caveat:** an EOA can still be a hardware-backed or MPC-custodied key with strong
   operational controls. Chain data can only tell us it is *not a contract* — it cannot show us
   Robinhood's internal controls. The correct statement is therefore: **there is no on-chain
   mitigation; the protection is entirely institutional trust in Robinhood.**

   The deny-list is also **actively used** — 246 `Blocked` events on the registry (sampled entries
   are EOAs, including burn addresses like `0x…dead`), against 4 `Unblocked`. It is live
   operational machinery, not a dormant capability, so a pool address being blocked is a real
   scenario to design for rather than a theoretical one.
4. **Trading MCP jurisdiction coverage** vs Stock Token availability (120+ countries, varies).
5. ~~Can a CONTRACT receive a Stock Token?~~ **RESOLVED — production evidence, no deployment
   needed.** 67 contract holders across the four sampled Stock Tokens, including a Uniswap-style
   `PoolManager` holding 4,806 NVDA, a **`StockVault`** holding 18.4 AAPL, and third-party
   `Index Basket APPLCAT` / `Index Basket 401k` contracts. Contracts do not merely *tolerate*
   Stock Tokens — they already custody them at scale, and some of those are clearly third-party
   rather than Robinhood infrastructure. **Phase 0 is complete.**

---

## 7. What this does to the existing Sui work

Not wasted, but be honest about what transfers:

- **The Move implementation does not port.** ~2,000 lines stay on Sui.
- **The design does.** Section 1's invariant table is the actual output of six audit rounds, and
  every item on it was learned by finding a real hole.
- **The audit method ports completely** — adversarial rounds with independent verification, and
  mutation-testing every guard. That method caught four guards in this repo that were deletable
  with a fully green suite, and three false claims in commit messages. Use it from day one on the
  Solidity rather than bolting it on at the end.
- **The Sui deployment remains valid** for non-Robinhood RWA collateral, if the hybrid is pursued.
